# Citi-Bike-Analysis
Information was gathered from Citi Bikes website at [Citi Bike Data Source](https://citibikenyc.com/system-data) to create a Tableau story with the aim of determining the average duration of travel by user type, if there is a difference between member and casusal users on what time they use the service, and to identify the top locations traveled to.


The Tableau story is located [Here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/joshua.aldridge/viz/CitiBike_16888655277100/CitiBikeStory)
