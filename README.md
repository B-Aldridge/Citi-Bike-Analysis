## Analysis Overview
#### Average Duration of Travel by User Type
One of the main objectives of this analysis is to determine the average duration of travel by user type. By comparing member and casual users, we can gain insights into how usage patterns differ between these two groups.

#### Usage Patterns by Time of Day
This analysis also aims to investigate if there is a difference between member and casual users in terms of the time they use the Citi Bike service. By examining usage patterns throughout the day, we can identify any variations in behavior between the two user types.
